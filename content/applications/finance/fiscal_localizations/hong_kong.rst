   consecutive contracts during their employment.

The following are critical for setting up a contract:

- :guilabel:`Working Schedule`: Set as HK Standard 40 hours/week (from employee record)
- :guilabel:`Salary Structue Type`: Set as CAP57: Hong Kong Employee.
- :guilabel:`Work Entry Source`: Select either :guilabel:`Working Schedule`, :guilabel:`Attendances` or :guilabel:`Planning`.
  This field determines how the work entries are accounted for in the payslip.

   - :guilabel:`Working Schedule`: The work entries are generated automatically based on the employee's working schedule.
   - :guilabel:`Attendances`: The work entries are generated based on the check-in/-out period logged in the *Attendances* app.
   - :guilabel:`Planning`: The work entries are generated from planning shifts only.

.. _hong_kong/running_payslips:

Generate payslips
-----------------

Once the employees and their contracts are configured, payslips can be generated in the *Payroll* app.

Odoo provides **four** different salary structures under CAP57 Regulation:

#. :guilabel:`Employees Monthly Pay`: To process the monthly employee salary.
#. :guilabel:`Payment in Lieu of Notice`: To process final payment upon contract termination.
#. :guilabel:`Long Service Payment`: Applicable to employees with more than five years of service upon
   contract termination.
#. :guilabel:`Severance Payment`: Applicable to employees with more than two years of service upon
   contract termination.

Before running the payslips, the accounts used in the salary rule can be adjusted by navigating to
:menuselection:`Payroll app --> Configurations --> Rules`.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-salary-rules.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Salary Rules

Odoo can create pay runs in **two** ways: via **batch** or **individual** payslips.

.. _hong_kong/batch_payslips:

Batch payslips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Payslips --> Batches`.
This method of payslip generation is used for recurring payments, since multiple employee payslips
can be managed at once.

#. Click on :guilabel:`New`.
#. Enter a :guilabel:`Batch Name` (e.g, `2024 â€“ Jan`) and :guilabel:`Period` (e.g. 01/01/2024 - 01/31/2024).
#. Click on :guilabel:`Generate Payslips`.
#. Choose which :guilabel:`Salary Structure` to use for this batch. The department filter allows the batch to
   apply to only a specific group of employees.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Generate`.
#. A :guilabel:`Payslips` smart button is created automatically.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-batch-payslips.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Batch Payslips

Next, click :guilabel:`Create Draft Entry` to generate a draft journal entry found in the :guilabel:`Other Info`
tab of each payslips. A :guilabel:`Confirmation` pop-up window appears asking `Are you sure you want to proceed?`.
Click :guilabel:`Ok` to create the journal entries.

Individual payslips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Payslips --> All Payslips`
This method of payslip generation is commonly used to handle non-recurring payments (e.g. Payment in Lieu
of Notice, Long Service Payment, Severance Payment).

#. Click on :guilabel:`New`.
#. Select an :guilabel:`Employee`; their :guilabel:`Contract` are filled out automatically.
#. Add a pay :guilabel:`Period`.
#. Select a salary :guilabel:`Structure` (e.g. Employees Monthly Pay)
#. The :guilabel:`Worked Days` tab automatically compute the worked days/hours and time off leaves
   that are applicable.
#. Additional payslip items can be added at this time (e.g. Commissions, Deductions) under the
   :guilabel:`Other Inputs` section.
#. Click on :guilabel:`Compute Sheet` button to generate the payslip lines. This button updates
   the :guilabel:`Salary Computation` tab.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-individual-payslip.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Individual Payslip

.. note::
   If the work entry for an employee was amended, click the :guilabel:` âš™ (gear)` icon, then click
   :guilabel:`Recompute Whole Sheet` to refresh the payslip's :guilabel:`Worked Days & Inputs` section.

The :guilabel:`Salary Computation` tab shows the detailed breakdown of the computation based on
the salary rules configured for each structure type.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-salary-computation.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Salary computation

#. :guilabel:`Rent Allowance`: Amount derived from the employee's active rental record.
#. :guilabel:`Basic Salary`: Amount of base salary provided (after rent allowance deduction)
#. :guilabel:`713 Gross`: Net payable amount considering Commission, Internet Allowance, Reimbursements,
   Back-pay, Deduction, etc.
#. :guilabel:`MPF Gross`: Net payable amount from 713 gross after consideration of additional allowances,
   deductions and end-of-year payment.
#. :guilabel:`Employee Mandatory Contribution`: Employee MPF Contribution
#. :guilabel:`Employer Mandatory Contribution`: Employer MPF Contribution
#. :guilabel:`Gross`: Net payable amount from MPF gross after consideration of MPF deductions.
#. :guilabel:`Net Salary`: Final payable amount to be paid to the employee.

.. important::
   There are no MPF contributions for the first month. Both **employee** and **employer**
   contribution starts on **second** month.

Under the :guilabel:`Other Inputs` tab at the bottom of payslip, there are additional manual input
types that are specific to *HK Payroll*:

- :guilabel:`Back Pay`: Additional salary payout can be included under this category.
- :guilabel:`Commission`: The commission earned during the period can be manually entered here.
- :guilabel:`Global Deduction`: A lump-sum deduction from the entire payslip.
- :guilabel:`Global Reimbursement`: A lump-sum reimbursement to the entire payslip.
- :guilabel:`Referral Fee`: The additional bonus offered for any form of business-related referral.
- :guilabel:`Moving Daily Wage`: To override the :abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)` value used for leaves computation.
- :guilabel:`Skip Rent Allowance`: If set, the rental allowance is excluded from the current payslip.
- :guilabel:`Custom Average Monthly Salary`: To override the average monthly salary used for end-of-year payment.

Once the payslips are ready, click :guilabel:`Create Draft entry` to generate a draft journal entry
found in the :guilabel:`Other Info` tab of the payslip.

Paying employees
----------------

Once the draft journal entries have been posted, the company can now pay the employees.
The user can choose between **two** different **payment methods**.

- From the employee's payslip (:menuselection:`Payroll app --> Payslips --> All Payslips`), once the payslip's journal
  entry has been posted, click :guilabel:`Register Payment`. The process is the same as
  :doc:`paying vendor bills <../accounting/payments>`. Select the desired bank journal and payment
  method, then later reconcile the payment with the corresponding bank statement.

- For batch payments, once all draft journal entries from the batch are confirmed, click :guilabel:`Mark as Paid`
  to post the payment journal entry. Then create a :doc:`payment <../accounting/payments>` in the *Accounting*
  app and reconcile accordingly.

Attendances & Hourly Wage
-------------------------

Setup the contract as follows for employees who are based paid on an hourly-wage contract:

.. important::
   Make sure the employee contract is using *Attendances* as the Work Entry Source and the Wage
   Type is set to :guilabel:`Hourly Wage`.

#. Go to *Attendance* app.
#. The employee can check-in/out via the kiosk mode.
#. In the *Payroll* app, review the attendance work entries generated from
   :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Work Entries --> Work Entries`.
#. Next, generate the :ref:`payslips <hong_kong/running_payslips>` and process the payment.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-attendance-work-entry.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Attendance Work Entry

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-attendance-payslip.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Attendance Payslip

Time Off with Payroll
---------------------

The work entry types and time off types are fully integrated between the *Time Off* and
*Payroll* apps. There are several time off types and work entry types specific to Hong Kong which are
installed automatically along with the *HK Payroll* module.

There are two checkboxes to be considered when setting up the work entry type:

- :guilabel:`Use 713`: This leave type to be included as part of 713 computation.
- :guilabel:`Non-full pay`: 80% of the :abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)`.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-work-entry-type.png
   :alt: Hong Kong Work Entry Type

Understanding 713 Ordinance
---------------------------

The *HK Payroll* module is compliant with 713 Ordinance which relates to the
:abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)` computation to ensure fair compensation for employees.

The ADW computation is as follows:

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-adw.png
   :alt: Hong Kong ADW Formula

.. note::
   For 418 compliance, there is no automated allocation of the **Statutory Holiday**
   entitlement to the employees. As soon as 418 requirements are met, manually allocate the leaves
   via the *Time Off* app.

.. note::
   Before generating payslips, ensure the statuses are :guilabel:`Done`
   to validate the outcome:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Period
     - Days
     - Wage
     - Commission
     - Total
     - ADW
     - Leave Value
   * - Jan
     - 31
     - $20200

     - $20200
     - $651.61 ($20200/31)
     - N/A

     - $769.49 ($45400/59)
     - N/A
   * - Mar (One Day Annual Leave)
     - 31

     - $0
     - -
     - -
     - $584.22 ($730.27*0.8)

Here is an example demonstrating the 713 logic:

- :guilabel:`Jan`: Generate a payslip with a monthly wage of $20200. The :abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)` is always computed on a cumulative basis of the trailing 12-months.
- :guilabel:`Feb`: Generate a similar payslip but add an :guilabel:`Other Input Type` for the Commission.
- :guilabel:`Mar`: Apply for **one** full-paid annual leave in March. The salary compensation for the leave taken is based on :abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)` thus far.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-march-713.png
   :alt: Hong Kong March 713

- :guilabel:`Apr`: Apply for a 1-day non-full pay leave in April. Since this is a non-full pay leave, the :abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)` is computed accordingly.

.. image:: hong_kong/hk-apr-713.png
   :alt: Hong Kong April 713

.. note::
   The value of :abbr:`ADW (Average Daily Wage)` is computed in the backend and not be visible to the user.
